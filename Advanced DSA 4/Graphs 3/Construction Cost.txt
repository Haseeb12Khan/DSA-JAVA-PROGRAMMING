				QUESTION
Flipkart has ‘A’ local distribution centers located across a large metropolitan city. 
Each distribution center needs to be interconnected through roads to facilitate efficient movement of goods. 
The cost of constructing a road between any two distribution centers is represented by the weight of the edge connecting them.

Given a graph with ‘A’ nodes representing the distribution centers and C weighted edges representing the possible roads between them. 
Your task is to find the minimum total cost of constructing roads such that every distribution center can be reached from the first distribution center.

Cost Calculation: The cost of constructing the roads is the sum of the weights of the edges selected for the construction.

NOTE: Return the answer modulo 10^9+7 as the answer can be large.


Problem Constraints:	1 <= A <= 100000
			0 <= C <= 100000
			1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= N
			1 <= B[i][2] <= 10^9

Input Format:
	-> First argument is an integer A.
	-> Second argument is a 2-D integer array B of size C×3 denoting edges. 
	-> B[i][0] and B[i][1] are the distribution centers connected by the i-th edge with construction cost B[i][2].

Output Format:
	-> Return an integer denoting the minimum construction cost.

Example Input:
	Input 1:	A = 3
			B = [[1, 2, 14],[2, 3, 7],[3, 1, 2]]
                  
	Input 2:	A = 3
			B = [[1, 2, 20],[2, 3, 17]]
          
Example Output:
	Output 1:	9

	Output 2:	37

Example Explanation:
	Explanation 1:	To connect the distribution centers, we can select only two roads: from center 2 to center 3 (cost 7) and from center 3 to center 1 (cost 2). 
			This allows us to reach the first distribution center from both center 2 and center 3, resulting in a total construction cost of 7+2=9.

	Explanation 2:	In this case, we must construct both roads to ensure that all distribution centers are reachable from the first center. 
			The total cost will be 20+17=37.

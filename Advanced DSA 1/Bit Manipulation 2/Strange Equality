				QUESTION
Given an integer A.
	Two numbers, X and Y, are defined as follows:
X is the greatest number smaller than A such that the XOR sum of X and A is the same as the sum of X and A.
Y is the smallest number greater than A, such that the XOR sum of Y and A is the same as the sum of Y and A.
	Find and return the XOR of X and Y.

NOTE 1: XOR of X and Y is defined as X ^ Y where '^' is the BITWISE XOR operator.
NOTE 2: Your code will be run against a maximum of 100000 Test Cases.

Problem Constraints:	1 <= A <= 10^9

Input Format:
	-> First and only argument is an integer A.

Output Format:
	-> Return an integer denoting the XOR of X and Y.

Example Input:	A = 5

Example Output:	10

Example Explanation:
	-> The value of X will be 2 and the value of Y will be 8. The XOR of 2 and 8 is 10.

				SOLUTION

public class Solution 
{
	public int solve(int A) 
	{
        	int highestBit = 0;
        	int temp = A;
        	while(temp > 0)
		{
            		highestBit++;
            		temp >>= 1;
        	}
        	int X = (1<<highestBit) - 1 - A;
        	int Y = 1<<highestBit;
        	return X ^ Y;
    	}
}
